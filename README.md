👋 Hi, I’m @raffayshahid <br />
👀 I’m interested in software development and solving problems through technology. I have experience working with C++ and various other programming languages such as Bash, Python, R, Java, Swift, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS.<br />   
🌱 I’m currently learning about new frameworks and tools such as Django, MongoDB, Bootstrap, AWS, GDB, Git, Jira, Linux, and Unix to enhance my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.<br />   
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to software development and technology.<br />
